- 👋 Hi, I’m @coryRibley
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, learning, fitness, eating, and playing instruments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development to steer me toward getting my first developer job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would be a good enough challenge for me, though not too much of one. I don't want to feel like I am drowning in my first collaborative project!
- 📫 You can reach me through GitHub, or email at Coryribley@gmail.com.
